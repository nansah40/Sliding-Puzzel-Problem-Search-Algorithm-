# Sliding-Puzzel-Problem-Search-Algorithm-
Implemented several search algorithms to solve the 8 piece sliding puzzle problem in Java 

## Features
- Used A*, Breath First, Depth First, and Uniform Cost Search alogorthims to the solve sliding puzzel problem.

- The program generates a random board state and then runs one of the 4 previously mentioned alogorithms on the board until it reahces the desired goal state.
  
- The goal state and desried algortionm can be set in the main method of the program. 

- The output of a run of depth first search on a randomly genrated board state can be seen in the figure down below.

- The number of board states visited, the borad states, and the final goal board state are displayed in the output.
