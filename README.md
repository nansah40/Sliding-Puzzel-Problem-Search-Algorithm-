# Sliding-Puzzel-Problem-Search-Algorithm-
Implemented several search algorithms to solve the 8 piece sliding puzzle problem in Java 

## Features
- Used A*, Breath First, Depth First, and Uniform Cost Search alogorthims to the solve sliding puzzel problem.

- The output of a run of depth first search on a randomlt genrated board state can be seen in the figure down below.
